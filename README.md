## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Mobile workflow at the end

### What I learned

I have learned about @media, overlay, position, flex direction and mix-blend-mode

```css

Also about the display option:

.main {
  margin: 24px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

And finally, how to adjust sizes of images, texts and boxes according to the size of the screen:

@media (max-width: 476px) {
  section {
    height: 600px;
    width: 302px;
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
    position: absolute;
    justify-content: flex-end;
  }
```css
### Continued development

In the future, my goal is:
- learn the property of position in more depth
- better organize html
- 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This helped me about many properties.
- [CCS Web Docs](https://devdocs.io/css/display) - This helped me with the display properties.
